excerpt: Why I prefer the metaphor of a garden to a blog, and how tending to ideas over time leads to better thinking.

The traditional blog format has always felt slightly off to me. Posts arranged chronologically, each one expected to be complete and polished, frozen in time the moment you hit publish. It's a format borrowed from journalism, and it carries that medium's assumptions about how ideas should work.

## A Different Metaphor

Digital gardens offer a different way of thinking about online writing. Instead of finished articles, you cultivate notes. Instead of a timeline, you build a web of interconnected ideas. Some notes are seeds—barely more than a thought. Others have grown into full essays. Most exist somewhere in between.

The metaphor of gardening is powerful because it acknowledges that ideas need time to develop. You plant a seed, you water it occasionally, you see what grows. Some plants thrive; others don't make it. That's fine. The garden as a whole is what matters.

## Learning in Public

There's a vulnerability to sharing half-formed thoughts. We're trained to present polished work, to have all the answers before we speak. But some of the most interesting writing comes from people thinking out loud, working through problems in real-time.

A digital garden gives you permission to be incomplete. To say "here's what I'm thinking about" rather than "here's what I've concluded." That shift opens up different kinds of conversations.

## Starting Small

This site isn't a full digital garden yet, but the principles inform how I'm approaching it. Posts here aren't meant to be definitive statements. They're snapshots of thinking that I expect to evolve over time.

If you're interested in this approach, I'd recommend starting with a single note about something you're curious about. Don't worry about making it perfect. Just plant the seed and see what happens.
