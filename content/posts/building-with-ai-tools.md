excerpt: An exploration of how AI coding assistants are changing the way we build software, and what I learned using one to create this very website.

There's something poetic about using AI to build a personal website—a space meant to be distinctly human—with the help of artificial intelligence. Over the past few days, I've been experimenting with AI-assisted development tools, and this site is the result.

## The Setup

I started with a clear vision: a minimal, nature-inspired personal site built with modern tools. The stack is straightforward—Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Nothing revolutionary, but solid foundations for a fast, maintainable site.

What made this project different was the collaboration. Instead of writing every line myself, I worked alongside Claude Code, describing what I wanted and iterating on the results. It felt less like programming and more like a conversation about design.

## What Worked Well

The speed was remarkable. What might have taken a weekend of fiddling with configurations and styling came together in hours. The AI understood my aesthetic preferences—earthy colors, generous whitespace, subtle animations—and translated them into working code.

More importantly, it handled the tedious parts: setting up the build system, configuring Tailwind, creating the responsive layouts. This freed me to focus on what actually matters—the content and the overall feel of the site.

## What I Learned

AI tools are amplifiers, not replacements. They work best when you have a clear vision and can articulate what you want. The more specific I was about my preferences, the better the results.

They're also remarkably good at pattern recognition. When I mentioned wanting something "organic" and "natural," the AI picked up on those cues and created subtle gradient backgrounds and rounded shapes that evoked those feelings.

## Looking Forward

This is just the beginning. I'm planning to add a projects section, integrate some interactive experiments, and maybe even add a digital garden for notes and ideas. The foundation is here—now it's time to grow.

If you're curious about AI-assisted development, I'd encourage you to try it. Not as a replacement for learning to code, but as a way to explore ideas faster and push past the friction that often stops us from building things.
