### Assignment

Explore claude code by making a personal site. How can we improve claude code as a harness? What are skills? How do we add / create skills? What security measure can we put in place? Hooks? 

The goal is to create a personal site with claude and then write a blog post about how you did it. 

A couple different phases.
 - Phase 1: Improve claude to help you make this site e.g. skills, hooks, etc.
 - Phase 2: Execution. Implement the site.
 - Phase 3: Deploy the site. 

 ### Planning

 - I've got claude code already, no biggie.
 - Need to add a couple of skills for web, meaning frontend design etc. Probably add playwright mcp. Add a couple of hooks to avoid nuking my mac. We can use hooks for that.
- I want my site to be all purpose. This includes contact info, resume, blog posts, projects, and probably something else I can't forsee. 
- I want my site to be easy to use (writing and publishing blog posts should be fairly straight forward), but highly extendable in case I want to host projects or whatever.
- I've already got a domain so that's taken care of.
- What do I want my site to look like? On one hand I really like minimal sites if I'm reading, for example, a blog post or whatever; they're easy to maintain. But they're a little boring tbh. Not bad, but not sure if that's what I want right now. I think a big goal for my site, if I were to actually use it, is to be mobile friendly. 
- What other designs or angles beside minimalistic could be fun? Maybe retro? or idk. We'll figure it out.
- I explored some styles that might be out there a little bit like maybe a website that's like an impressionist painting, or maybe something that's like an analog film stip or something. But that might be a little too much to get done right now. I think I'll go ahead with a more minimalistic style for now and once we have the site up and running then we'll figure out some styling.
- I have this simple art explorer project which I think would be nice to add to the site: https://github.com/julianwemmie/chicago-art-institute-explorer
